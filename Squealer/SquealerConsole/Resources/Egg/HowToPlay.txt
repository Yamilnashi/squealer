To join an existing leaderboard, fill in the connection string.

To create a new leaderboard, find the TOP SECRET script. It's really hard to find. Then share the connection string with your fellow rebel scum.

If you do not want to connect to a leaderboard, make sure your connection string is blank. Otherwise, the game will attempt to connect and you will have to wait for it to time out.

To play the game, type HELP STARWARS at the command prompt.
