Padmé Amidala is pregnant.
Nobody knows she is going to have twins,
not even the Jedi.

Anakin Skywalker freaks out over
this mysterious woman thing
and becomes Darth Vader.

The galaxy falls under a reign of terror.

This all happens because
even though medical droids can fix a guy
who falls into a pool of lava,

THERE JUST AREN'T ANY OBGYNS IN SPACE.
