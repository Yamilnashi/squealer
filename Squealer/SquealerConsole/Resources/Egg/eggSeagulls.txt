Episode II

or...

S E A G U L L S !
(STOP IT NOW!)

[Yoda]
Penny for your thoughts.

[Luke Skywalker]
I hate Brenda, and a bad guy hit me in the shin, and I peed on all my pants!

[Yoda]
It's nothing a little music can't help.

Rockin'
Rockin' and rollin'
Down to the beach I'm strollin'
But the seagulls poke at my head
Not fun!
I said, "Seagulls... mmgh! Stop it now!"

Hmm ha! Hmm hmm ha!

Everyone told me
Not to stroll on that beach
Said seagulls gonna come
Poke me in the coconut
And they did
And they did
Had me goin' like

Aaaah ah ah ah aaaaah ah
Aaaah ah ah ah aaaaah ah

Nothing I could do but yell
When these birds attacked me
When I tried to run I fell
And then these kids start laughing
And then
Got hit in the neck with a hacky sack
Where'd it come from?
Now run, run, run, jump!
I can be a backpack while you run
Run, run, run, jump!
And stop
Put me down
I love to groove and boogie
Yeah

[Luke Skywalker]
Great.

[Yoda]
Show you some dance moves...

[Luke Skywalker]
No, I don't want you to.

[Yoda]
If I had your giant feet
Out there on the beach
Could have outrun those birds

[Luke Skywalker]
You're a psycho wiener!

[Yoda]
Let me grab my beater

Hmm ha! Hmm hmm ha!

[R2D2]
Stop it please!
Don't hit me
Please
Don't hit me

[Luke Skywalker]
Come on man! Quit that banging!

[Yoda]
Hey, what's that stank?

[Luke Skywalker]
You put a fish in our basket!

[Yoda]
Oh, yeah!
I forgot I did that.

[Luke Skywalker]
You owe me an apology!

[Yoda]
Just hold your breath and see
When the time is right
Birds'll bite your face
Now run, run, run, jump!
I can be a backpack while you run
Swing from a hairy vine
I can be your backpack while you climb
Stand on one hand and lift
Rocks with your special gift
Run, run, run, jump!
Now breathe

That's good
Like that
Like that

One day I was walking and I found this big log
Then I rolled the log over
And underneath was a tiny little stick
And I was like, "That log had a child!"

Listen, boy
Someday when you are older
You could get hit by a boulder
While you're lying there
Screaming, "Come help me please!"
The seagulls poke your knees

Hmm ha! Hmm hmm ha!
Stop it now!
Hmm ha! Hmm hmm ha!

[Luke Skywalker]
Yeah, whatever, you're sorta pitchy.

[Yoda]
Didn't like it?

[Luke Skywalker]
Listen, man, I'm not your friend.

[Yoda]
Don't fall asleep.

Don't
fall
asleep
