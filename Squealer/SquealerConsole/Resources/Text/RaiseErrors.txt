There are two ways to cause the stored procedure to roll back the transaction.


(1) Set the return code which will bubble up to the outermost nested stored procedure. MSSQL will not generate an error.

begin
	set @SqlrInternalErrorNumber = ?; -- Value must be between -99999 and -1.
	raiserror('',11,1);
end;


(2) Cause a fatal SQL crash that must be handled by the calling process outside of the outermost nested procedure.
begin
	set @SqlrInternalErrorNumber = -999999;
	raiserror('An error happened because...',11,1);
end;
